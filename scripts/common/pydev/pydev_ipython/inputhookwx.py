    This version runs the wx eventloop for an undetermined amount of time,

    stdin.  If anything is ready on stdin, the event loop exits.
    
    The argument to elr.Run controls how often the event loop looks at stdin.
    This determines the responsiveness at the keyboard.  A setting of 1000
    enables a user to type at most 1 char per second.  I have found that a
    setting of 10 gives good keyboard response.  We can shorten it further,
    but eventually performance would suffer from calling select/kbhit too
    often.
